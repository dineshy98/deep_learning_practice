### Notes on Historical Volatility Estimation Methods

#### **1. Overview of Historical Volatility:**
- **Volatility Definition:** Historical volatility measures the past price fluctuations of a financial instrument.
- **Limitations of Settlement Prices:** Using only settlement prices to calculate volatility can be misleading, particularly when there are significant intraday price movements. 

#### **2. Alternative Methods for Calculating Historical Volatility:**
- **Extreme-Value Method (Parkinson, 1980):**
  - **Formula:**  
    \[
    \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \cdot \frac{\ln(2)}{2t} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\ln(h_i/l_i))^2}
    \]  
    where:  
    - \( h_i \): High price during the interval  
    - \( l_i \): Low price during the interval  
    - \( t \): Length of each time interval (in years)  
    - \( n \): Number of intervals  
  - **Advantages:**  
    - Accounts for intraday price extremes.  
    - Useful when no definitive settlement prices are available.  
    - Provides a more complete picture of volatility compared to close-to-close methods.  

- **Open-High-Low-Close Method (Garman-Klass, 1980):**
  - **Formula:**  
    \[
    \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \cdot \frac{\ln(2)}{t} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( (\ln(h_i/l_i))^2 - (2 \ln(2) - 1)(\ln(c_i/o_i))^2 \right)}
    \]  
    where:  
    - \( o_i \): Opening price  
    - \( c_i \): Closing price  
    - \( h_i \): High price  
    - \( l_i \): Low price  
  - **Advantages:**  
    - Expands the Parkinson method by incorporating opening and closing prices.  
    - Further refines the accuracy of volatility estimates.  

#### **3. Annualizing Volatility:**
- All methods are annualized to make them comparable:
  - **Approach:** Divide by the square root of \( t \) (the time between price intervals) or multiply by the square root of the number of intervals in a year.

#### **4. Comparison of Methods:**
- **Close-to-Close Volatility:**
  - Considers only closing prices.
  - Can overstate volatility due to its inability to capture intraday price extremes.
- **Parkinson and Garman-Klass Methods:**
  - Tend to yield lower volatility estimates.
  - Consider only periods when the market is open and trading is continuous.  
  - May underestimate volatility if the market is closed for a significant part of the day.

#### **5. Adjustments for Non-Continuous Markets:**
- Markets like the EuroStoxx 50 Index are not continuously calculated (e.g., only 9:00 a.m. to 6:50 p.m. in European time).  
- **Recommendation by Garman and Klass:**
  - Combine observable volatility (Parkinson or Garman-Klass) with close-to-close volatility using weighted averages.  
  - Weight observable volatility based on the proportion of the day the market is open.  
  - In practice, close-to-close estimates often have a higher weight because most markets are closed for a longer time.

#### **6. Practical Implications:**
- **Accuracy of Estimates:**  
  - Parkinson and Garman-Klass are more accurate when markets are continuously trading.  
  - For non-continuous markets, adjustments must be made.  
- **Weighting Options:**  
  - Equal weighting is a simple solution.  
  - Garman and Klass propose precise formulas for optimal weighting.  

#### **7. Key Takeaways:**
- **Choice of Method:** The chosen method typically does not significantly impact trading success.
- **Focus on Interpretation:** Traders should focus on interpreting volatility data rather than stressing over the exact method.
- **Future Realized Volatility:** Historical volatility is a guideline for predicting future realized volatility.

### **Tips & Tricks for Traders:**
1. **Understand the Market Conditions:**  
   - Use methods like Parkinson and Garman-Klass for markets with continuous trading.  
   - Incorporate close-to-close estimates for markets with long non-trading periods.  

2. **Weighting Strategies:**  
   - For non-continuous markets, give higher weight to close-to-close volatility if markets are closed for most of the day.  
   - Alternatively, use equal weighting for simplicity if precise formulas are unnecessary.  

3. **Practicality vs. Precision:**  
   - Slight differences between methods generally have minimal impact on strategy success.  
   - Choose a method that aligns with the trading style and market availability.

4. **Annualization Consistency:**  
   - Ensure consistent annualization across all methods for proper comparison.  

5. **Use Historical Volatility as a Guide, Not a Rule:**  
   - Historical volatility provides context for potential future price behavior, but itâ€™s not a deterministic factor for future success.  

By focusing on the practical application of these methods and their interpretation, traders can enhance their decision-making process and improve strategy formulation.
